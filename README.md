* Also, this has been covered with one mandatory item i.e Owesome Mocha Reporting.
* It has one main file named: TestSuite which has all test cases under it blocks.
* For Execution, you need to run only 'TestSuite.cy.js' file.

* All calling data are created under fixtures Json files. 
* This Project covers Page Object Model and all object related paths (DOM) are writen under POM folder.

*Highlighted Notes*
* This Demo Website has some sign in Module unstability, that's why I need to handled it with calling sign in feature again & again. some scripts are commented out because sometimes its working fine and sometimes doesn't. 
* For Shipping Address Section, I've commented out 4 lines because Shipping addres has been saved so no need for shipping scripts again on added account. 
* All 7 cases have been sucessfully passed with Firefix browser, some cases may failed over chrome/others browsers due to unstability of demo website. 
* I've added All Cases Passed Screenshot and Demo Website unstability Screenshot over the Email.

Thank you
